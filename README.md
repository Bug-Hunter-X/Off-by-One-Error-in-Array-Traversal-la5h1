This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java. The `bug.java` file contains code that attempts to access an array element beyond its valid index, resulting in an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. The `bugSolution.java` file provides the corrected code.  This is a subtle but frequent error that can lead to unexpected program behavior and crashes.
